/**
Assume a suitable value for distance between two cities (in km.). 
Write a Java program to convert and print this distance in meters, 
feet, inches and centimeters. 
**/
FORMULA:
1KM = 1000M
1M = 100 cm
1inch = cm/2.54
feet = inch/12

package distance;
public class cal_distance
{
public static void main (Strings[]args)
{
int distance = 2;//in km
int meter = distance * 1000;// 2000m
int cm = meter * 100;
int inch = cm /2.54;
int feet= inch/12
System.out.Println (meter+" "+cm+""+inch+""+feet);
}
